	<h3> <STRONG>Challenge 1:</STRONG> Scanning my Hand </h3>
		<p> When introduced to all of the possibilities of scanning, I was rather excited. Unfortuantely, time permitted me to only use Sense, which was rather fun! The difficulty in this had to do with: <em> Light Reflection: Skin Versus Leather </em> </p>
		<p> Each time I tried to scan my hand (both on my own and with the help of a classmate), it failed. The sensor would lose track of the hand I was trying to scan. HandyDandy Rob suggested we try using a leather glove that was laying around, and the first time scanning, VOILA! </p>
	<h3> <STRONG>Challenge 2:</STRONG> 3D Modeling </h3>	

	
		<p> After a particularly useful mini-tutorial on Fusion360 (and the debate continues between Fusion360 v Rhino/Grasshopper v Antimony and external supports), from a lovely TA, I was feeling rather confident in the possibilities of my ability. And, of course, I got stuck. Specifically on creating the arch. There were continuous errors based upon the angle to which I was trying to <em> sweep </em> my rectangular base. I tried to change the curve, the shape of the base, and continued to fail. </p>
		<p> What finally worked was when I used the arc of a circle to define my arch. I decided to use this and continue on, at this point choosing to modify my design from ths awesome politically-charged idea in my mind, to something more basic, where I could ensure that the entire process was not hindered.</p>
